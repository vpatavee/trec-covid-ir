# TREC-COVID Challenge

TREC-COVID Challenge is an Information Retrieval (IR) challenge for COVID-19 research papers.

In a nutshell, we are given the massive researh papers about COVID-19 and a set of topics i.e. 
where is COVID-19 origin? The goal is to retrieve the documents that have answers for each topic.
For formal task definition, dataset, evaluation and so on, visit the [official website](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit).

TREC-COVID Challenge is series of rounds. As of 8/2/2020, there five rounds. Each round comes with
new topics and new research papers. In this repo, I will use [round 4 dataset](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/data.html),
where the human judgement is available.
